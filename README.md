# SuperHot-Clone
 Attempting to recreate SuperHot in Godot 4

Recreated the time altering based on player velocity. Added acceleration to make the movement less immediate.

I added an NPC and box with very basic animation to show the effect.

Figuring out main gameplay loop while fleshing out physics. Might switch to third person if it continues to be a platformer, as that would be more fun. If it's a shooter it will stay in first person because the slow mo will be visible on enemies.
